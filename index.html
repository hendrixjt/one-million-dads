                    <h5>The Mission?</h5>
                    <p>The mission of One Million Dads, is the mission of Ezekiel 37. The men of the church have
                        long
                        been asleep. We have relinquished our God given position of leadership. Not to subjugate
                        our
                        families, but to lead them with the loving hand of Christ. Our hope is to wake up the
                        fearsome
                        wonder that is the mighty man of God and restore him to his role as leader, teacher,
                        counselor,
                        and then thereby change the world we live in for the better. </p>

                    <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm" data-toggle="collapse" href="#why">Read On</button>

                    <p id="why" class="collapse mt-2">I have felt burdened for some time to reach out
                        to Christian
                        men in my
                        age bracket, to encourage
                        and equip them for daily life. I am by no means a minister, but I do have a heart for God’s
                        people. The name One Million Dads has some history with AFA. Years ago, it took more of an
                        activist role, but the new 1MD’s purpose is one of ministry. Online ministry to the men of the
                        church. Now a lot of people would say, shouldn’t you be ministering to people outside the walls
                        of the church? The answer to that is, until the men of the Church stand up and become the
                        leaders that God called them to be, then communication with the world will always be difficult.
                        The reason I felt burdened to do this now, is due to the increasing statistics based on
                        fatherless homes. Suicide, homelessness, alcoholism, drug abuse, incarceration and on and on and
                        on are all higher when Dad is not in the home. And if Dad can’t be in the home (divorce) then at
                        least he can be involved in his children’s lives.

                        1MD’s message is this, Christ loves you enough to die for you. He has plans for your life. He
                        wants you to return to Him, so that He can make you the person He always meant you to be. Come
                        join us, as we go forward and learn as men of the Cross together. </p>

                                        Christian is “real” before God. When he has finished with all that the world has
                                        to offer, finished with everything he thought would satisfy him, and finished
                                        with every attempt to gain favor with God.</p>

                                    One Million Dads use it a lot in various teachings. Still, what exactly does
                                    “Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for
                                    it” mean? I think the best way to answer the question is to first examine the

                                    Christmas. Most seem to be reverential of Christ’s birth. We go out of our way to
                                    say Merry Christmas to all we know, sometimes with the love of Christ in our hearts,
                                    and sometimes with fire and brimstone. Yet during Easter, there seems to be a lack
                                    of excitement among the brethren. We all strive to buy that new tie or a new suit,
                                    but do we seek to tell others of the monumental moment in our lives as believers?
